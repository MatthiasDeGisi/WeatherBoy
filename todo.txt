maybe either make an attribute for the timer time so it can be set, or see if bot can be converted into oop so it can be set

seems like a cog might be the way to do this. put all commands 
into the cog, put my timers in the cog, and make the timer time
 an attribute in the cog. then can bind normally, and retrieve 
 with a method found here: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/commands/cogs.html
