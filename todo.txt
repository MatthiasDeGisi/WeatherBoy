so basically check badge status and get badge status are different things. Get badge status will probably return data in the format:
{
    "darren":
        {
            "has_badge": True,
            "badge_time": 1H10M
        },
    "brandon":
        {
            "has_badge": False,
            "badge_time": 0H00M
        }
}


more like this [{id: xxx, fname: darren,etc}]
